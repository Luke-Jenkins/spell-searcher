You assume a different form. When you cast the spell,
choose one of the following options, the effects of which
last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts,

Programmed Illusion

you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits
of a different one.

Aquatic Adaptation. You adapt your body to an
aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing
webbing between your fingers. You can breathe
underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your
walking speed.

Change Appearance. You transform your appearance.

You decide what you look like, including your height,
weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length,
coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any.
You can make yourself appear as a member of another
race, though none of your statistics change. You also
can't appear as a creature of a different size than you,
and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal,
you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for
instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you
can use your action to change your appearance in

this way again.

Natural Weapons. You grow claws, fangs, spines,
horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your
unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or
slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon
you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed
strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you
have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you
make using it.
